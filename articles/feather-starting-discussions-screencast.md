For those of you that aren't aware of my doings, I'm in the process of developing a forum bundle for Laravel 3. This bundle has no set release date because I couldn't be bothered trying to meet a personal deadline.

The forum is called **[Feather](http://github.com/featherforums)**. Cool, huh? Anyway I've decided to do a bunch of short screencasts when I get to a certain stage with things. First up is the current implementation of starting new discussions.

Enjoy!

Note that features are still under construction, things may and most likely *will* change.

Hope everyone is coding some awesome things in [Laravel](http://laravel.com)!
