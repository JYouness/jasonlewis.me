Hello and welcome to the brand new blog. I've finally managed to migrate my blog from Wordpress to my own blogging engine called [Two Cents](http://jasonlewis.me/code/twocents).

Two Cents is a Git based blogging engine written in Laravel. So, what on earth am I talking about? Well, this article  that you're reading right now is actually stored on GitHub. I can make changes to it and push the changes to GitHub and they'll eventually be pushed out to here. Don't believe me? [Take a look!](https://github.com/jasonlewis/jasonlewis.me/blob/master/articles/welcome-to-the-new-blog.md) Pretty slick, huh?

At the time of writing I'm still converting my old articles over, but I should get there, eventually. Anywho, I hope you like what you see.

More to follow!
