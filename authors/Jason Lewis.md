My name is Jason Lewis, I'm a web developer and firefighter from Australia! I first began coding way back in 2005 because I always had wondered how websites work. I'm now pretty darn good at coding things with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few other things. I'm a huge fan of the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) framework, so check that out!
